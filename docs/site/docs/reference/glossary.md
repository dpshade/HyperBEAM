# Glossary

This glossary provides definitions for terms and concepts used throughout the HyperBEAM documentation.

### AO-Core Protocol
The underlying protocol that HyperBEAM implements, enabling decentralized computing and communication between nodes.

### Asynchronous Message Passing
A communication paradigm where senders don't wait for receivers to be ready, allowing for non-blocking operations and better scalability.

### Compute Unit (CU)
The NodeJS component of HyperBEAM that executes WebAssembly modules and handles computational tasks.

### Decentralized Execution
The ability to run processes across a distributed network without centralized control or coordination.

### Device
A functional unit in HyperBEAM that provides specific capabilities to the system, such as storage, networking, or computational resources.

### Erlang
The programming language used to implement the HyperBEAM core, known for its robustness and support for building distributed, fault-tolerant applications.

### HyperBEAM
The Erlang-based node software that handles message routing, process management, and device coordination in the HyperBEAM ecosystem.

### Message
A data structure used for communication between processes in the HyperBEAM system. Messages are asynchronously passed between processes.

### Module
A unit of code that can be loaded and executed by the Compute Unit, typically in WebAssembly format.

### Node
An instance of HyperBEAM running on a physical or virtual machine that participates in the distributed network.

### Process
An independent unit of computation in HyperBEAM with its own state and execution context.

### Process ID
A unique identifier assigned to a process within the HyperBEAM system.

### WebAssembly (WASM)
A binary instruction format that serves as a portable compilation target for programming languages, enabling deployment on the web and other environments.
